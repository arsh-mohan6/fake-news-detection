📰 Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning (Python + NLP)  
A robust machine learning project to detect fake news articles based on textual data. It performs end-to-end data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction using multiple NLP techniques and classification algorithms.

📌 Features  
✅ Data cleaning and preprocessing using NLP  
📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
🤖 Multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.)  
📈 Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, F1-score  
🧠 Real-time prediction system for new/unseen news  
📁 Modular notebook workflow

🚀 How It Works  
1. Load and clean the dataset using NLP techniques (stopwords removal, stemming, etc.)  
2. Explore the dataset with graphs to understand patterns in fake vs. real news  
3. Train machine learning models and evaluate their performance  
4. Enter your own news text in the final notebook to check if it's fake or real
